shooting-likelihood
===================

Extracted the XY_POINT data from 06-07 season, used Kernel Density Estimation to build the distribution of success shooting and fail ones. Then built a matrix of success rate in every xy-point,finally use the data from 07-08 and 08-09 season to prove the accuracy of these matrix.
